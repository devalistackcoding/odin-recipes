# odin-recipes

Using the instructions from the Odin website, I successfully built a recipe website using plain HTML. 

I created an index.html file and added three links to each recipe. 

Using the terminal, I created an image folder and linked the images for each recipe, which I downloaded from a free resource website. 

From now on, I can confidently create links, lists, images, paragraphs, and headers.
